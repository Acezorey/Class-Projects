# Bank-Database
In this repository is the code for the Bank Database project for one of my ICS classes.

Written entirely in C, this project was meant as a culimation and a demonstration of all of what we learned in the class in regards to the C programming language.

This program was also written in accordance to the coding style dictated by that class' curriculum.
